Everything in this universe is\nmade up of material which scientists have\nnamed “matter”. The air we breathe, the food\nwe eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and\nanimals, even a small drop of water or a\nparticle of sand — every thing is matter. We\ncan also see as we look around that all the\nthings mentioned above occupy space and\nhave mass. In other words, they have both\nmass* and volume**.\nSince early times, human beings have\nbeen trying to understand their surroundings.\nEarly Indian philosophers classified matter in\nthe form of five basic elements — the “Panch\nTatva” — air, earth, fire, sky and water.\nAccording to them everything, living or non-\nliving, was made up of these five basic\nelements. Ancient Greek philosophers had\narrived at a similar classification of matter.\nModern day scientists have evolved two\ntypes of classification of matter based on their\nphysical properties and chemical nature.\nIn this chapter we shall learn about\nmatter based on its physical properties.\nChemical aspects of matter will be taken up\nin subsequent chapters.\n1.1  Physical Nature of Matter\n1.1.1 MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES\nFor a long time, two schools of thought prevailed\nregarding the nature of matter. One school\nbelieved matter to be continuous like a block\nof wood, whereas, the other thought that matter\nwas made up of particles like sand. Let us\nperform an activity to decide about the nature\nof matter — is it continuous or particulate?\nActivity ______________ 1.1\n•\nTake a 100 mL beaker.\n•\nFill half the beaker with water and\nmark the level of water.\n•\nDissolve some salt/ sugar with the help\nof a glass rod.\n•\nObserve any change in water level.\n•\nWhat do you think has happened to\nthe salt?\n•\nWhere does it disappear?\n•\nDoes the level of water change?\nIn order to answer these questions we\nneed to use the idea that matter is made up\nof particles. What was there in the spoon,  salt\nor sugar, has now spread throughout  water.\nThis is  illustrated in Fig. 1.1.\n1.1.2 HOW SMALL ARE THESE PARTICLES\nOF MATTER?\nActivity ______________ 1.2\n•\nTake 2–3 crystals of potassium\npermanganate and dissolve them in\n100 mL of water.\nFig. 1.1: When we dissolve salt in water, the particles\nof salt get into the spaces between particles\nof water.\n*\nThe SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg).\n**\nThe SI unit of volume is cubic metre (m3). The common unit of measuring volume is\nlitre (L) such that 1L = 1 dm3, 1L = 1000 mL, 1 mL = 1 cm3.\n1\nMATTER\nATTER\nATTER\nATTER\nATTER IN\nIN\nIN\nIN\nIN O\n O\n O\n O\n OUR\nUR\nUR\nUR\nUR S\n S\n S\n S\n SURROUNDINGS\nURROUNDINGS\nURROUNDINGS\nURROUNDINGS\nURROUNDINGS\nC hapter\nReprint 2025-26"

We can see that\nmatter around us exists in three different\nstates– solid, liquid and gas. These states of\nmatter arise due to the variation in the\ncharacteristics of the particles of matter.\nNow, let us study about the properties of\nthese three states of matter in detail.\n1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE\nActivity _____________  1.9\n•\nCollect the following articles — a pen,\na book, a needle and a piece of wooden\nstick.\n•\nSketch the shape of the above articles\nin your notebook by moving a pencil\naround them.\n•\nDo all these have a definite shape,\ndistinct boundaries and a fixed volume?\n•\nWhat happens if they are hammered,\npulled or dropped?\n•\nAre these capable of diffusing into each\nother?\n•\nTry compressing them by applying\nforce. Are you able to compress them?\nAll the above are examples of solids. We\ncan observe that all these have a definite\nshape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\nthat is, have negligible compressibility. Solids\nhave a tendency to maintain their shape when\nsubjected to outside force. Solids may break\nunder force but it is difficult to change their\nshape, so they are rigid.\nConsider the following:\n(a) What about a rubber band, can it\nchange its shape on stretching? Is it\na solid?\n(b) What about sugar and salt? When\nkept in different jars these take the\nshape of the jar. Are they solid?\n(c) What about a sponge? It is a solid\nyet we are able to compress it. Why?\nAll the above are solids as:\n•\nA rubber band changes shape under\nforce and regains the same shape when\nthe force is removed. If excessive force is\napplied, it breaks.\n•\nThe shape of each individual sugar or\nsalt crystal remains fixed, whether we\ntake it in our hand, put it in a plate or in\na jar.\n•\nA sponge has minute holes, in which\nair is trapped, when we press it, the air\nis expelled out and we are able to\ncompress it.\n1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE\nActivity _____________1.10\n•\nCollect the following:\n(a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a\ncold drink.\n(b) containers of different shapes. Put\na 50 mL mark on these containers\nusing a measuring cylinder from\nthe laboratory.\n•\nWhat will happen if these liquids are\nspilt on the floor?\n•\nMeasure 50 mL of any one liquid and\ntransfer it into different containers one\nby one. Does the volume remain the\nsame?\n•\nDoes the shape of the liquid remain the\nsame ?\n•\nWhen you pour the liquid from one\ncontainer into another, does it flow\neasily?\nWe observe that liquids have no fixed\nshape but have a fixed volume. They take up\nthe shape of the container in which they are\nkept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\nare not rigid but can be called fluid.\nRefer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we\nsaw that solids and liquids can diffuse into\nliquids. The gases from the atmosphere\ndiffuse and dissolve in water. These gases,\nespecially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are\nessential for the survival of aquatic animals\nand plants.\nAll living creatures need to breathe for\nsurvival. The aquatic animals can breathe\nunder water due to the presence of dissolved\noxygen  in water. Thus, we may conclude that\nsolids, liquids and gases can diffuse into\nliquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is\nReprint 2025-26"

This is due to the\nfact that in the liquid state, particles move\nfreely and have greater space between each\nother as compared to particles in the solid\nstate.\n1.3.3 THE GASEOUS STATE\nHave you ever observed a balloon seller filling\na large number of balloons from a single\ncylinder of gas? Enquire from him how many\nballoons is he able to fill from one cylinder.\nAsk him which gas does he have in the cylinder.\nActivity _____________1.11\n•\nTake three 100 mL syringes and close\ntheir nozzles by  rubber corks, as\nshown in Fig.1.4.\n•\nRemove the pistons from all the\nsyringes.\n•\nLeaving one syringe untouched, fill\nwater in the second and pieces of chalk\nin the third.\n•\nInsert the pistons back into the\nsyringes. You may apply some vaseline\non the pistons before inserting them\ninto the syringes for their smooth\nmovement.\n•\nNow, try to compress the content by\npushing the piston in each syringe.\nWe have observed that gases are highly\ncompressible as compared to solids and\nliquids. The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)\ncylinder that we get in our home for cooking\nor the oxygen supplied to hospitals in\ncylinders is compressed gas. Compressed\nnatural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days\nin vehicles. Due to its high compressibility,\nlarge volumes of a gas can be compressed\ninto a small cylinder and transported easily.\nWe  come to know of what is being cooked\nin the kitchen without even entering there,\nby the smell that reaches our nostrils. How\ndoes this smell reach us? The particles of the\naroma of food mix with the particles of air\nspread from the kitchen, reach us and even\nfarther away. The smell of hot cooked food\nreaches us in seconds; compare this with the\nrate of diffusion of solids and liquids. Due to\nhigh speed of particles and large space\nbetween   them, gases show the property of\ndiffusing very fast into other gases.\nIn the gaseous state, the particles move\nabout randomly at high speed. Due to this\nrandom movement, the particles hit each\nother and also the walls of the container. The\npressure exerted by the gas is because of this\nforce exerted by gas particles per unit area\non the walls of the container.\nFig. 1.4\n•\nWhat do you observe? In which case\nwas the piston easily pushed in?\n•\nWhat do you infer from your\nobservations?\nFig.1.5: a, b and c show the magnified schematic\npictures of the three states of matter. The\nmotion of the particles can be seen and\ncompared in the three states of matter.\nReprint 2025-26"

The\nparticles leave their fixed positions and start\nmoving more freely. A stage is reached when\nthe solid melts and is converted to a liquid.\nThe minimum temperature at which a solid\nmelts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\npressure is called its melting point.\nThe melting point of a solid is an indication\nof the strength of the force of attraction\nbetween its particles.\nThe melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The\nprocess of melting, that is, change of solid\nstate into liquid state is also known as fusion.\nWhen a solid melts, its temperature\nremains the same, so where does the heat\nenergy go?\nYou must have observed, during the\nexperiment of melting, that the temperature\nof the system does not change after the\nmelting point is reached, till all the ice melts.\nThis happens even though we continue to\nheat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\nheat. This heat gets used up in changing the\nstate by overcoming the forces of attraction\nbetween the particles. As this heat energy is\nabsorbed by ice without showing any rise in\ntemperature, it is considered that it gets\nhidden into the contents of the beaker and is\nknown as the latent heat. The word latent\nmeans hidden. The amount of heat energy\nthat is required to change 1 kg of a solid into\nliquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting\npoint is known as the latent heat of fusion.\nSo, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more\nenergy as compared to particles in ice at the\nsame temperature.\nWhen we supply heat energy to water,\nparticles start moving even faster.  At a certain\ntemperature, a point is reached when the\nparticles have enough energy to break free\nfrom the forces of attraction of each other. At\nthis temperature the liquid starts changing\ninto gas. The temperature at which a liquid\nstarts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is\nknown as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk\nphenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the\nliquid gain enough energy to change into the\nvapour state.\nFor water this temperature is 373 K\n(100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K).\nCan you define the latent heat of\nvaporisation? Do it in the same way as we\nhave defined the latent heat of fusion.\nParticles in steam, that is, water vapour at\n373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water\nat the same temperature. This is because\nparticles in steam have absorbed extra energy\nin the form of latent heat of vaporisation.\n*Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after\nrounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you\nhave to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius\nscale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.\nSo, we infer that the state of matter can\nbe changed into another state by changing\nthe temperature.\nWe have learnt that substances around\nus change state from solid to liquid and from\nliquid to gas on application of heat.

For example, milk is\nactually a mixture of water, fat, proteins, etc.\nWhen a scientist says that something is pure,\nit means that all the constituent particles of\nthat substance are the same in their chemical\nnature.

The component of the solution\nthat dissolves the other component in it\n(usually the component present in larger\namount) is called the solvent. The component\nof the solution that is dissolved in the solvent\n(usually present in lesser quantity) is called\nthe solute.\nExamples:\n(i)\nA solution of sugar in water is a solid\nin liquid solution. In this solution,\nsugar is the solute and water is\nthe solvent.\n(ii)\nA solution of iodine in alcohol known\nas ‘tincture of iodine’, has iodine (solid)\nas the solute and alcohol (liquid) as the\nsolvent.\n(iii)\nAerated drinks like soda water, etc., are\ngas in liquid solutions.

Its two main constituents are:\noxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%). The\nother gases are present in very\nsmall quantities.\nProperties of a Solution\n•\nA solution is a homogeneous mixture.\n•\nThe particles of a solution are smaller\nthan 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter. So,\nthey cannot be seen by naked eyes.\n•\nBecause of very small particle size, they\ndo not scatter a beam of light passing\nthrough the solution. So, the path of\nlight is not visible in a solution.\n•\nThe solute particles cannot be separated\nfrom the mixture by the process of\nfiltration. The solute particles do not\nsettle down when left undisturbed, that\nis, a solution is stable.\n2.2.1 CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION\nIn activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and\nB obtained different shades of solutions. So,\nwe understand that in a solution the relative\nproportion of the solute and solvent can be\nvaried. Depending upon the amount of solute\npresent in a solution, it can be called  dilute,\nconcentrated or  saturated solution. Dilute\nand concentrated are comparative terms. In\nactivity 2.2, the solution obtained by group\nA is dilute as compared to that obtained by\ngroup B.\nActivity ______________ 2.3\n•\nTake approximately 50 mL of water\neach in two separate beakers.\n•\nAdd salt in one beaker and sugar or\nbarium chloride in the second beaker\nwith continuous stirring.\n•\nWhen no more solute can be dissolved,\nheat the contents of the beaker to raise\nthe temperature by about 5oC.°\n•\nStart adding the solute again.\nIs the amount of salt and sugar or barium\nchloride, that can be dissolved in water at a\ngiven temperature, the same?\nAt any particular temperature, a solution\nthat has dissolved as much solute as it is\ncapable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated\nsolution. In other words, when no more solute\ncan be dissolved in a solution at a given\ntemperature, it is called a saturated solution.\nThe amount of the solute present in the\nsaturated solution at this temperature is called\nits solubility.\nIf the amount of solute contained in a\nsolution is less than the saturation level, it is\ncalled an unsaturated solution.\nWhat would happen if you were to take a\nsaturated solution at a certain temperature\nand cool it slowly.\nWe can infer from the above activity that\ndifferent substances in a given solvent have\ndifferent solubilities at the same temperature.\nThe concentration of a solution is the amount\n(mass or volume) of solute present in a given\namount (mass or volume) of solution.\nThere are various ways of expressing the\nconcentration of a solution, but here we will\nlearn only three methods.\n(i)\nMass by mass percentage of a solution\nMass of solute\n=\n×100\nMass of solution\nReprint 2025-26"

A suspension is a heterogeneous\nmixture in which the solute particles do not\ndissolve but remain suspended throughout\nthe bulk of the medium. Particles of a\nsuspension are visible to the naked eye.\nProperties of a Suspension\n•\nSuspension is a heterogeneous\nmixture.\n•\nThe particles of a suspension can be seen\nby the naked eye.\n•\nThe particles of a suspension scatter a\nbeam of light passing through it and\nmake its path visible.\n•\nThe solute particles settle down when a\nsuspension is left undisturbed, that is,\na suspension is unstable. They can be\nseparated from the mixture by the\nprocess of filtration. When the particles\nsettle down, the suspension breaks and\nit does not scatter light any more.\n2.2.3 WHAT IS A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION?\nThe mixture obtained by group D in activity\n2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution.\nThe particles of a colloid are uniformly spread\nthroughout the solution. Due to the relatively\nsmaller size of particles, as compared to that of\na suspension, the mixture appears to be\nhomogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution\nis a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk.\nBecause of the small size of colloidal\nparticles, we cannot see them with naked eyes.\nBut, these particles can easily scatter a beam\nof visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This\nscattering of a beam of light is called the\nTyndall effect after the name of the scientist\nwho discovered this effect.\nTyndall effect can also be observed when a\nfine beam of light enters a room through a small\nhole. This happens due to the scattering of light\nby the particles of dust and smoke in the air.\nFig. 2.3: (a) Solution of copper sulphate does not\nshow Tyndall effect, (b) mixture of water\nand milk shows Tyndall effect.\n(a)\n(b)\nReprint 2025-26"

The\nproperties that can be observed and specified\nlike colour, hardness, rigidity, fluidity,\ndensity, melting point, boiling point etc. are\nthe physical properites.\nThe interconversion of states is a physical\nchange because these changes occur without\na change in composition and no change in the\nchemical nature of the substance. Although\nice, water and water vapour all look different\nand display different physical properties, they\nare chemically the same.\nBoth water and cooking oil  are liquid but\ntheir chemical characteristics are different.\nThey differ in odour and inflammability. We\nknow that oil burns in air whereas water\nextinguishes fire. It is this chemical property\nof oil that makes it different from water.\nBurning is a chemical change. During this\nprocess one substance reacts with another to\nundergo a change in chemical composition.\nChemical change brings change in the\nchemical properties of matter and we get new\nsubstances. A chemical change is also called\na chemical reaction.\nDuring burning of a candle, both physical\nand chemical changes take place.

Antoine Laurent\nLavoisier (1743–94), a French chemist, was the\nfirst to establish an experimentally useful\ndefinition of an element. He defined an element\nas a basic form of matter that cannot be broken\ndown into simpler substances by chemical\nreactions.\nElements can be normally divided into\nmetals, non-metals and metalloids.\nMetals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n•\nThey have a lustre (shine).\n•\nThey have silvery-grey or golden-yellow\ncolour.\n•\nThey conduct heat and electricity.\n•\nThey are ductile (can be drawn into\nwires).\n•\nThey are malleable (can be hammered\ninto thin sheets).\n•\nThey are sonorous (make a ringing\nsound when hit).\nExamples of metals are gold, silver,\ncopper, iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mercury\nis the only metal that is liquid at room\ntemperature.\nNon-metals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n•\nThey display a variety of colours.\n•\nThey are poor conductors of heat and\nelectricity.\n•\nThey are not lustrous, sonorous\nor malleable.\nExamples of non-metals are hydrogen,\noxygen, iodine, carbon (coal, coke), bromine,\nReprint 2025-26"

    "text": "Ancient Indian and Greek philosophers have\nalways wondered about the unknown and\nunseen form of matter. The idea of divisibility\nof matter was considered long back in India,\naround 500 BC. An Indian philosopher\nMaharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on\ndividing matter (padarth), we shall get smaller\nand smaller particles. Ultimately, a stage will\ncome when we shall come across the smallest\nparticles beyond which further division will\nnot be possible.  He named these particles\nParmanu. Another Indian philosopher,\nPakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine\nand said that these particles normally exist\nin a combined form which gives us various\nforms of matter.\nAround the same era, ancient Greek\nphilosophers – Democritus and Leucippus\nsuggested that if we go on dividing matter, a\nstage will come when particles obtained\ncannot be divided further. Democritus called\nthese indivisible particles atoms (meaning\nindivisible). All this was based on\nphilosophical considerations and not much\nexperimental work to validate these ideas\ncould be done till the eighteenth century.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century,\nscientists recognised the difference between\nelements and compounds and naturally\nbecame interested in finding out how and why\nelements combine and what happens when\nthey combine.\nAntoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation\nof chemical sciences by establishing two\nimportant laws of chemical combination.\n3.1 Laws of Chemical Combination\nThe following two laws of chemical\ncombination were established after\nmuch experimentations by Lavoisier and\nJoseph L.

Thus,\nif 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen\nand 8 g of oxygen are always obtained.\nSimilarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen\nare always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass,\nwhatever the method or the source from which\nit is obtained.\nThis led to the law of constant proportions\nwhich is also known as the law of definite\nproportions. This law was stated by Proust as\n“In a chemical substance the elements are\nalways present in definite proportions by\nmass”.\nThe next problem faced by scientists was\nto give appropriate explanations of these laws.\nBritish chemist John Dalton provided the\nbasic theory about the nature of matter.\nDalton picked up the idea of divisibility of\nmatter, which was till then just a philosophy.\nHe took the name ‘atoms’ as given by the\nGreeks and said that the smallest particles of\nmatter are atoms. His theory was based on the\nlaws of chemical combination. Dalton’s atomic\ntheory provided an explanation for the law of\nconservation of mass and the law of\ndefinite proportions.\nJohn Dalton was born in\na poor weaver’s family in\n1766 in England. He\nbegan his career as a\nteacher at the age of\ntwelve. Seven years later\nhe became a school\nprincipal. In 1793, Dalton\nleft for Manchester to\nteach \nmathematics,\nphysics and chemistry in\na college. He spent most of his life there\nteaching and researching. In 1808, he\npresented his atomic theory which was a\nturning point in the study of matter.\nAccording to Dalton’s atomic theory, all\nmatter, whether an element, a compound or\na mixture is composed of small particles called\natoms. The postulates of this theory may be\nstated as follows:\n(i)\nAll matter is made of very tiny particles\ncalled atoms, which participate in\nchemical reactions.\n(ii)\nAtoms are indivisible particles, which\ncannot be created or destroyed in a\nchemical reaction.\n(iii)\nAtoms of a given element are identical\nin mass and chemical properties.\n(iv)\nAtoms of different elements have\ndifferent masses and chemical\nproperties.\n(v)\nAtoms combine in the ratio of small\nwhole numbers to form compounds.\n(vi)\nThe relative number and kinds of\natoms are constant in a given\ncompound.\nYou will study in the next chapter that all\natoms are made up of still smaller particles.\n uestions\n1.\nIn a reaction, 5.3 g of sodium\ncarbonate reacted with 6 g of\nacetic acid.

For\nexample, the name copper was taken from\nCyprus. Some names were taken from\nspecific colours. For example, gold was taken\nfrom the English word meaning yellow.\nNow-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of\nPure and Applied Chemistry) is an\ninternational scientific organisation which\napproves names of elements, symbols and\nunits. Many of the symbols are the first one\nor two letters of the element’s name in\nEnglish. The first letter of a symbol is always\nwritten as a capital letter (uppercase) and the\nsecond letter as a small letter (lowercase).\nFor example\n(i)\nhydrogen, H\n(ii)\naluminium, Al and not AL\n(iii)\ncobalt, Co and not CO.\nSymbols of some elements are formed from\nthe first letter of the name and a letter,\nappearing later in the name. Examples are: (i)\nchlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc.\nOther symbols have been taken from the\nnames of elements in Latin, German or Greek.\nFor example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its\nLatin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium,\npotassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each\nelement has a name and a unique\nchemical symbol.\n(The above table is given for you to refer to\nwhenever you study about elements. Do not\nbother to memorise all in one go. With the\npassage of time and repeated usage you will\nautomatically be able to reproduce\nthe symbols).\n3.2.2 ATOMIC MASS\nThe most remarkable concept that Dalton’s\natomic theory proposed was that of the atomic\nmass. According to him, each element had a\ncharacteristic atomic mass. The theory could\nexplain the law of constant proportions so well\nthat scientists were prompted to measure the\natomic mass of an atom. Since determining the\nmass of an individual atom was a relatively\ndifficult task, relative atomic masses were\ndetermined using the laws of chemical\ncombinations and the compounds formed.\nLet us take the example of a compound,\ncarbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and\noxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3\ng of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to\nform CO. In other words, carbon combines\nwith 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose\nwe define the atomic mass unit (earlier\nabbreviated as ‘amu’, but according to the\nlatest IUPAC recommendations, it is now\nwritten as ‘u’ – unified mass) as equal to the\nmass of one carbon atom, then we would\nassign carbon an atomic mass of 1.0 u and\noxygen an atomic mass of 1.33 u.

This was\nconsidered relevant due to two reasons:\n•\noxygen reacted with a large number of\nelements and formed compounds.\n•\nthis atomic mass unit gave masses of\nmost of the elements as whole numbers.\nHowever, in 1961 for a universally\naccepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope\nwas chosen as the standard reference for\nmeasuring atomic masses. One atomic mass\nunit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth\n(1/12th) the mass of one atom of carbon-12.\nThe relative atomic masses of all elements\nhave been found with respect to an atom of\ncarbon-12.\nImagine a fruit seller selling fruits without\nany standard weight with him. He takes a\nwatermelon and says, “this has a mass equal\nto 12 units” (12 watermelon units or 12 fruit\nmass units). He makes twelve equal pieces of\nthe watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit\nhe is selling, relative to the mass of one piece\nof the watermelon.

The existence of different\nkinds of matter is due to different atoms\nconstituting them. Now the questions arise:\n(i) What makes the atom of one element\ndifferent from the atom of another element?\nand (ii) Are atoms really indivisible, as\nproposed by Dalton, or are there smaller\nconstituents inside the atom? We shall find\nout the answers to these questions in this\nchapter. We will learn about sub-atomic\nparticles and the various models that have\nbeen proposed to explain how these particles\nare arranged within the atom.\nA major challenge before the scientists at\nthe end of the 19th century was to reveal the\nstructure of the atom as well as to explain its\nimportant properties. The elucidation of the\nstructure of atoms is based on a series of\nexperiments.\nOne of the first indications that atoms are\nnot indivisible, comes from studying static\nelectricity and the condition under which\nelectricity is conducted by different\nsubstances.\n4.1 Charged Particles in Matter\nFor understanding the nature of charged\nparticles in matter, let us carry out the\nfollowing activities:\nActivity ______________ 4.1\nA.\nComb dry hair. Does the comb then\nattract small pieces of paper?\nB.\nRub a glass rod with a silk cloth and\nbring the rod near an inflated balloon.\nObserve what happens.\nFrom these activities, can we conclude\nthat on rubbing two objects together, they\nbecome electrically charged? Where does this\ncharge come from? This question can be\nanswered by knowing that an atom is divisible\nand consists of charged particles.\nMany scientists contributed in revealing\nthe presence of charged particles in an atom.\nIt was known by 1900 that the atom was\nindivisible particle but contained at least one\nsub-atomic particle – the electron identified by\nJ.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was\nidentified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the\npresence of new radiations  in a gas discharge\nand called them canal rays. These rays were\npositively charged radiations which ultimately\nled to the discovery of another sub-atomic\nparticle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge,\nequal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that\nof the electron. Its mass was approximately\n2000 times as that of the electron. It was given\nthe name of proton. In general, an electron is\nrepresented as ‘e–’ and a proton as ‘p+’. The\nmass of a proton is taken as one unit and its\ncharge as plus one. The mass of an electron is\nconsidered to be negligible and its charge is\nminus one.\nIt seemed that an atom was composed of\nprotons and electrons, mutually balancing\ntheir charges. It also appeared that the protons\nwere in the interior of the atom, for whereas\nelectrons could easily be removed off but\nnot protons. Now the big question was:\nwhat sort of structure did  these particles of\nthe atom form? We will find the answer to\nthis question below.\n4\nSTRUCTURE\nTRUCTURE\nTRUCTURE\nTRUCTURE\nTRUCTURE OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF THE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE A\n A\n A\n A\n ATOM\nTOM\nTOM\nTOM\nTOM\nC hapter\nReprint 2025-26"

But the\ndiscovery of two fundamental particles\n(electrons and protons) inside the atom, led\nto the failure of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic\ntheory. It was then considered necessary to\nknow how electrons and protons are arranged\nwithin an atom. For explaining this, many\nscientists proposed various atomic models.\nJ.J. Thomson was the first one to propose a\nmodel for the structure of an atom.\n4.2.1 THOMSON’S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nThomson proposed the model of an atom to\nbe similar to that of a Christmas pudding.\nThe electrons, in a sphere of positive charge,\nwere like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical\nChristmas pudding. We can also think of a\nwatermelon, the positive charge in the atom\nis spread all over like the red edible part of\nthe watermelon, while the electrons are\nstudded in the positively charged sphere, like\nthe seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1).\nThomson proposed that:\n(i)\nAn atom consists of a positively\ncharged sphere and the electrons are\nembedded in it.\n(ii)\nThe negative and positive charges are\nequal in magnitude. So, the atom as a\nwhole is electrically neutral.\nAlthough Thomson’s model explained that\natoms are electrically neutral, the results of\nexperiments carried out by other scientists\ncould not be explained by this model, as we\nwill see below.\n4.2.2 RUTHERFORD’S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nErnest Rutherford was interested in knowing\nhow the electrons are arranged within an\natom. Rutherford designed an experiment for\nthis. In this experiment, fast moving alpha\n(α)-particles were made to fall on a thin\ngold foil.\n•\nHe selected a gold foil because he wanted\nas thin a layer as possible. This gold foil\nwas about 1000 atoms thick.\n•\nα-particles are doubly-charged helium\nions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the\nfast-moving \nα-particles \nhave \na\nconsiderable amount of energy.\n•\nIt was expected that α-particles would be\ndeflected by the sub-atomic particles in\nthe gold atoms. Since the α-particles were\nmuch heavier than the protons, he did\nnot expect to see large deflections.\nQ\nFig.4.1: Thomson’s model of an atom\nJ.J. Thomson (1856–\n1940), \n \na \nBritish\nphysicist, was born in\nCheetham Hill, a suburb\nof \nManchester, \non\n18 December 1856. He\nwas awarded the Nobel\nprize in Physics in 1906\nfor his work on the\ndiscovery of electrons.

The\nfollowing observations were made:\n(i)\nMost of the fast moving α-particles\npassed straight through the gold foil.\n(ii)\nSome of the α-particles were deflected\nby the foil by small angles.\n(iii)\nSurprisingly one out of every 12000\nparticles appeared to rebound.\nIn the words of Rutherford, “This result\nwas almost as incredible as if you fire a\n15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it\ncomes back and hits you”.\nHe will hear a sound when each stone strikes\nthe wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will\nhear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded\nchild were to throw stones at a barbed-wire\nfence, most of the stones would not hit the\nfencing and no sound would be heard. This is\nbecause there are lots of gaps in the fence\nwhich allow the stone to pass through them.\nFollowing a similar reasoning, Rutherford\nconcluded from the α-particle scattering\nexperiment that—\n(i)\nMost of the space inside the atom is\nempty because most of the α-particles\npassed through the gold foil without\ngetting deflected.\n(ii)\nVery few particles were deflected from\ntheir path, indicating that the positive\ncharge of the atom occupies very little\nspace.\n(iii)\nA very small fraction of α-particles\nwere deflected by 1800, indicating that\nall the positive charge and mass of the\ngold atom were concentrated in a very\nsmall volume within the atom.\nFrom the data he also calculated that the\nradius of the nucleus is about 105 times less\nthan the radius of the atom.\nOn the basis of his experiment,\nRutherford put forward the nuclear model of\nan atom, which had the following features:\n(i)\nThere is a positively charged centre in\nan atom called the nucleus. Nearly all\nthe mass of an atom resides in the\nnucleus.\n(ii)\nThe electrons revolve around the\nnucleus in circular paths.\n(iii)\nThe size of the nucleus is very small\nas compared to the size of the atom.\nDrawbacks of Rutherford’s model of\nthe atom\nThe revolution of the electron in a circular orbit\nis not expected to be stable. Any particle in a\ncircular orbit would undergo acceleration.\nDuring acceleration, charged particles would\nradiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron\nwould lose energy and finally fall into the\nnucleus. If this were so, the atom should be\nhighly unstable and hence matter would not\nexist in the form that we know. We know that\natoms are quite stable.\nE. Rutherford (1871–1937)\nwas born at Spring Grove\non 30 August 1871. He was\nknown as the ‘Father’ of\nnuclear physics.  He is\nfamous for his work on\nradioactivity and the\ndiscovery of the nucleus of an atom with\nthe gold foil experiment. He got the Nobel\nprize in chemistry in 1908.\nLet us think of an activity in an open field\nto understand the implications  of this\nexperiment.

In fact, elements are defined by the number\nof protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1,\nbecause in hydrogen atom, only one proton\nis present in the nucleus. Similarly, for\ncarbon, Z = 6. Therefore, the atomic number\nis defined as the total number of protons\npresent in the nucleus of an atom.\n4.5.2 MASS NUMBER\nAfter studying the properties of the sub-\natomic particles of an atom, we can conclude\nthat mass of an atom is practically due to\nprotons and neutrons alone. These are\npresent in the nucleus of an atom. Hence\nprotons and neutrons are also called\nnucleons. Therefore, the mass of an atom\nresides in its nucleus. For example, mass of\ncarbon is 12 u because it has 6 protons and\n6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the\nmass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons+14\nneutrons). The mass number is defined as the\nsum of the total number of protons and\nneutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. It\nis denoted by ‘A’. In the notation for an atom,\nthe atomic number, mass number and symbol\nof the element are to be written as:\nMass Number\nQ\nSymbol of\nelement\nAtomic Number\nFor example, nitrogen is written as 14\n7 N .\nuestions\n1.\nIf number of electrons in an atom\nis 8 and number of protons is also\n8, then (i) what is the atomic\nnumber of the atom? and (ii) what\nis the charge on the atom?\n2.\nWith the help of Table 4.1, find\nout the mass number of oxygen\nand sulphur atom.\n4.6 Isotopes\nIn nature, a number of atoms of some\nelements have been identified, which have the\nsame atomic number but different mass\nnumbers.

    "text": "THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE\n51\nThe shape and size of cells are related to\nthe specific function they perform. Some cells\nlike Amoeba have changing shapes. In some\ncases the cell shape could be more or less\nfixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell;\nfor example, nerve cells have a typical shape.\nEach living cell has the capacity to\nperform certain basic functions that are\ncharacteristic of all living forms. How does\na living cell perform these basic functions?\nWe know that there is a division of labour in\nmulticellular organisms such as human\nbeings. This means that different parts of\nthe human body perform different functions.\nThe human body has a heart to pump blood,\na stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly,\ndivision of labour is also seen within a single\ncell. In fact, each such cell has got certain\nspecific components within it known as cell\norganelles. Each kind of cell organelle\nperforms a special function, such as making\nnew material in the cell, clearing up the\nwaste material from the cell and so on. A\ncell is able to live and perform all its\nfunctions because of these organelles. These\norganelles together constitute the basic unit\ncalled the cell. It is interesting that all cells\nare found to have the same organelles, no\nmatter what their function is or what\norganism they are found in.\nuestions\n1.\nWho discovered cells, and how?\n2.\nWhy is the cell called the\nstructural and functional unit of\nlife?\n5.2 What is a Cell Made Up of?\nWhat is the Structural\nOrganisation of a Cell?\nWe saw above that the cell has special\ncomponents called organelles. How is a cell\norganised?\nIf we study a cell under a microscope, we\nwould come across three features in almost\nevery cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and\ncytoplasm. All activities inside the cell and\ninteractions of the cell with its environment\nare possible due to these features. Let us see\nhow.\n5.2.1 PLASMA MEMBRANE OR CELL\nMEMBRANE\nThis is the outermost covering of the cell that\nseparates the contents of the cell from its\nexternal environment. The plasma membrane\nallows or permits the entry and exit of some\nmaterials in and out of the cell. It also\nprevents movement of some other materials.\nThe cell membrane, therefore, is called a\nselectively permeable membrane.\nHow does the movement of substances\ntake place into the cell? How do substances\nmove out of the cell?\nSome substances like carbon dioxide or\noxygen can move across the cell membrane\nby a process called diffusion. We have studied\nthe process of diffusion in earlier chapters.\nWe saw that there is spontaneous movement\nof a substance from a region of high\nconcentration to a region where its\nconcentration is low.\nSomething similar to this happens in cells\nwhen, for example, some substance like CO2\n(which is cellular waste and requires to be\nexcreted out by the cell) accumulates in high\nconcentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s\nexternal environment, the concentration of\nCO2 is low as compared to that inside the\ncell. As soon as there is a difference of\nconcentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell,\nCO2 moves out of the cell, from a region of\nhigh concentration, to a region of low\nconcentration outside the cell by the process\nof diffusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by\nthe process of diffusion when the level or\nconcentration of O2 inside the cell decreases.\nThus, diffusion plays an important role in\ngaseous exchange between the cells as well\nas the cell and its external environment.\nWater also obeys the law of diffusion. The\nmovement of water molecules through such a\nselectively permeable membrane is called osmosis.\nQ\nReprint 2025-26"

    "text": "SCIENCE\n52\n52\n52\n52\n52\nThe movement of water across the plasma\nmembrane is also affected by the\namount of substance dissolved in water. Thus,\nosmosis is the net diffusion of water across a\nselectively permeable membrane toward a\nhigher solute concentration.\nWhat will happen if we put an animal cell\nor a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt\nin water?\nOne of the following three things could\nhappen:\n1.\nIf the medium surrounding the cell has\na higher water concentration than the\ncell, meaning that the outside solution\nis very dilute, the cell will gain water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypotonic solution.\nWater molecules are free to pass\nacross the cell membrane in both\ndirections, but more water will come\ninto the cell than will leave. The net\n(overall) result is that water enters the\ncell. The cell is likely to swell up.\n2.\nIf the medium has exactly the same\nwater concentration as the cell, there\nwill be no net movement of water across\nthe cell membrane. Such a solution is\nknown as an isotonic solution.\nWater crosses the cell membrane in\nboth directions, but the amount going\nin is the same as the amount going out,\nso there is no overall movement of\nwater. The cell will stay the same size.\n3.\nIf \nthe \nmedium \nhas \na \nlower\nconcentration of water than the cell,\nmeaning that it is a very concentrated\nsolution, the cell will lose water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypertonic solution.\nAgain, water crosses the cell\nmembrane in both directions, but this\ntime more water leaves the cell than\nenters it. Therefore the cell will shrink.\nThus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion\nthrough a selectively permeable membrane.\nNow let us try out the following activity:\nActivity ______________ 5.3\n(a)\nRemove the shell of an egg by\ndissolving it in dilute hydrochloric\nacid. The shell is mostly calcium\ncarbonate. A thin outer skin now\nencloses the egg. Put the egg in pure\nwater and observe after 5 minutes.\nWhat do we observe?\nThe egg swells because water passes\ninto it by osmosis.\n(b)\nPlace a similar de-shelled egg in a\nconcentrated salt solution and observe\nfor 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why?\nWater passes out of the egg solution\ninto the salt solution because the salt\nsolution is more concentrated.\nWe can also try a similar activity with dried\nraisins or apricots.\nActivity ______________ 5.4\n•\nPut dried raisins or apricots in plain\nwater and leave them for some time.\nThen place them into a concentrated\nsolution of sugar or salt. You will\nobserve the following:\n(a)\nEach gains water and swells\nwhen placed in water.\n(b)\nHowever, when placed in the\nconcentrated solution it loses\nwater, and consequently shrinks.\nUnicellular freshwater organisms and\nmost plant cells tend to gain water through\nosmosis. Absorption of water by plant roots\nis also an example of osmosis.\nThus, diffusion is important in exhange\nof gases and water in the life of a cell. In\nadditions to this, the cell also obtains\nnutrition from its environment. Different\nmolecules move in and out of the cell\nthrough a type of transport requiring use\nof energy.\nThe plasma membrane is flexible and is\nmade up of organic molecules called lipids\nand proteins. However, we can observe the\nstructure of the plasma membrane only\nthrough an electron microscope.\nThe flexibility of the cell membrane also\nenables the cell to engulf in food and other\nmaterial from its external environment. Such\nprocesses are known as endocytosis. Amoeba\nacquires its food through such processes.\nReprint 2025-26"

The cell wall lies outside\nthe plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is\nmainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a\ncomplex substance and provides structural\nstrength to plants.\nWhen a living plant cell loses water\nthrough osmosis there is shrinkage or\ncontraction of the contents of the cell away\nfrom the cell wall. This phenomenon is known\nas plasmolysis. We can observe this\nphenomenon by performing the following\nactivity:\nActivity ______________ 5.6\n•\nMount the peel of a Rhoeo leaf in water\non a slide and examine cells under\nthe high power of a microscope. Note\nthe small green granules, called\nchloroplasts. They contain a green\nsubstance called chlorophyll. Put a\nstrong solution of sugar or salt on the\nmounted leaf on the slide.

Then mount one leaf on a slide\nand observe it under a microscope. Put\na strong solution of sugar or salt on\nthe mounted leaf on the slide. Wait for\na minute and observe it again. What\ndo we find? Did plasmolysis occur now?\nWhat do we infer from this activity? It\nappears that only living cells, and not dead\ncells, are able to absorb water by osmosis.\nCell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi\nand bacteria to withstand very dilute\n(hypotonic) external media without bursting.\nIn such media the cells tend to take up water\nby osmosis. The cell swells, building up\npressure against the cell wall. The wall exerts\nan equal pressure against the swollen cell.\nBecause of their walls, such cells can\nwithstand much greater changes in the\nsurrounding medium than animal cells.\n5.2.3 NUCLEUS\nRemember the temporary mount of onion peel\nwe prepared?

Were there similar\nstructures in onion peel cells?\nThe nucleus has a double layered covering\ncalled nuclear membrane. The nuclear\nmembrane has pores which allow the transfer\nof material from inside the nucleus to its\noutside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we\nwill talk about in section 5.2.4).\nThe nucleus contains chromosomes,\nwhich are visible as rod-shaped structures\nonly when the cell is about to divide.\nChromosomes contain information for\ninheritance of characters from parents to next\ngeneration in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are\ncomposed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules\ncontain the information necessary for\nconstructing and organising cells. Functional\nsegments of DNA are called genes. In a cell\nwhich is not dividing, this DNA is present as\npart of chromatin material. Chromatin\nmaterial is visible as entangled mass of thread\nlike structures. Whenever the cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin material gets organised\ninto chromosomes.\nThe nucleus plays a central role in cellular\nreproduction, the process by which a single\ncell divides and forms two new cells. It also\nplays a crucial part, along with the\nenvironment, in determining the way the cell\nwill develop and what form it will exhibit at\nmaturity, by directing the chemical activities\nof the cell.\nIn some organisms like bacteria, the\nnuclear region of the cell may be poorly\ndefined due to the absence of a nuclear\nmembrane. Such an undefined nuclear region\ncontaining only nucleic acids is called a\nnucleoid. Such organisms, whose cells lack\na nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes\n(Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon\n= nucleus). Organisms with cells having a\nnuclear membrane are called eukaryotes.\nProkaryotic cells (see Fig. 5.4) also lack\nmost of the other cytoplasmic organelles\npresent in eukaryotic cells. Many of the\nfunctions of such organelles are also\nperformed by poorly organised parts of the\ncytoplasm (see section 5.2.4).

This region takes up\nvery little stain. It is called the cytoplasm.\nThe cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the\nplasma membrane. It also contains many\nspecialised cell organelles. Each of these\norganelles performs a specific function for the\ncell.\nCell organelles are enclosed by\nmembranes. In prokaryotes, beside the\nabsence of a defined nuclear region, the\nmembrane-bound cell organelles are also\nabsent. On the other hand, the eukaryotic\ncells have nuclear membrane as well as\nmembrane-enclosed organelles.\nThe significance of membranes can be\nillustrated with the example of viruses.\nViruses lack any membranes and hence do\nnot show characteristics of life until they enter\na living body and use its cell machinery to\nmultiply.\nReprint 2025-26"

Large and complex cells,\nincluding cells from multicellular organisms,\nneed a lot of chemical activities to support\ntheir complicated structure and function. To\nkeep these activities of different kinds\nseparate from each other, these cells use\nmembrane-bound little structures (or\n‘organelles’) within themselves. This is one of\nthe features of the eukaryotic cells that\ndistinguish them from prokaryotic cells. Some\nof these organelles are visible only with an\nelectron microscope.\nWe have talked about the nucleus in a\nprevious section. Some important examples\nof cell organelles which we will discuss now\nare: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus,\nlysosomes, mitochondria and plastids. They\nare important because they carry out some\nvery crucial functions in cells.\n5.2.5 (i) ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER)\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large\nnetwork of membrane-bound tubes and\nsheets. It looks like long tubules or round or\noblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is\nsimilar in structure to the plasma membrane.\nThere are two types of ER– rough endoplasmic\nreticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic\nreticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a\nmicroscope because it has particles called\nribosomes attached to its surface. The\nribosomes, which are present in all active\ncells, are the sites of protein manufacture.\nThe manufactured proteins are then sent to\nvarious places in the cell depending on need,\nusing the ER. The SER helps in the\nmanufacture of fat molecules, or lipids,\nimportant for cell function. Some of these\nproteins and lipids help in building the cell\nmembrane. This process is known as\nmembrane biogenesis. Some other proteins\nand lipids function as enzymes and\nhormones. Although the ER varies greatly in\nappearance in different cells, it always forms a\nnetwork system.\nQ\nFig. 5.5: Animal cell\nThus, one function of the ER is to serve as\nchannels for the transport of materials\n(especially proteins) between various regions\nof the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm\nand the nucleus.

These membranes\noften have connections with the membranes\nof ER and therefore constitute another portion\nof a complex cellular membrane system.\nThe material synthesised near the ER is\npackaged and dispatched to various targets\ninside and outside the cell through the Golgi\napparatus. Its functions include the storage,\nmodification and packaging of products in\nvesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may\nbe made from simple sugars in the Golgi\napparatus. The Golgi apparatus is also\ninvolved in the formation of lysosomes [see\n5.2.5 (iii)].\nReprint 2025-26"

Therefore,\nlysosomes are also known as the ‘suicide bags’\nof a cell.\n5.2.5 (iv) MITOCHONDRIA\nMitochondria are known as the powerhouses\nof the cell. Mitochondria have two membrane\ncoverings. The outer membrane is porous\nwhile the inner membrane is deeply folded.\nThese folds increase surface area for ATP-\ngenerating chemical reactions. The energy\nrequired for various chemical activities needed\nfor life is released by mitochondria in the form\nof ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules.\nATP is known as the energy currency of the\ncell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for\nmaking new chemical compounds and for\nmechanical work.\nMitochondria are strange organelles in the\nsense that they have their own DNA and\nribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able\nto make some of their own proteins.\n5.2.5 (V) PLASTIDS\nPlastids are present only in plant cells. There\nare two types of plastids – chromoplasts\n(coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or\ncolourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing\nthe pigment chlorophyll are known as\nchloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for\nphotosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also\ncontain various yellow or orange pigments in\naddition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are\nprimarily organelles in which materials such\nas starch, oils and protein granules are stored.\nThe internal organisation of the Chloroplast\nconsists of numerous membrane layers\nembedded in a material called the stroma. These\nare similar to mitochondria in external\nstructure. Like the mitochondria, plastids also\nhave their own DNA and ribosomes.\n5.2.5 (vi) VACUOLES\nVacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid\ncontents. Vacuoles are small sized in animal\ncells while plant cells have very large vacuoles.\nThe central vacuole of some plant cells may\noccupy 50-90% of the cell volume.\nIn plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap\nand provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell.\nMany substances of importance in the life of\nthe plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These\ninclude amino acids, sugars, various organic\nacids and some proteins. In single-celled\norganisms like Amoeba, the food vacuole\ncontains the food items that the Amoeba has\nconsumed. In some unicellular organisms,\nspecialised vacuoles also play important roles\nin expelling excess water and some wastes\nfrom the cell.\nuestions\n1.\nCan you name the two organelles\nwe have studied that contain\ntheir own genetic material?\n2.\nIf the organisation of a cell is\ndestroyed due to some physical\nor chemical influence, what will\nhappen?\n3.\nWhy are lysosomes known as\nsuicide bags?\n4.\nWhere are proteins synthesised\ninside the cell?\nEach cell thus acquires its structure and\nability to function because of the organisation\nof its membrane and organelles in specific\nways. The cell thus has a basic structural\norganisation. This helps the cells to perform\nfunctions like respiration, obtaining nutrition,\nand clearing of waste material, or forming\nnew proteins.\nThus, the cell is the fundamental structural\nunit of living organisms.

    "text": "From the last chapter, we recall that all living\norganisms are made of cells. In unicellular\norganisms, a single cell performs all basic\nfunctions. For example, in Amoeba, a single\ncell carries out movement, intake of food,\ngaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi-\ncellular organisms there are millions of cells.\nMost of these cells are specialised to carry out\nspecific functions. Each specialised function\nis taken up by a different group of cells. Since\nthese cells carry out only a particular function,\nthey do it very efficiently. In human beings,\nmuscle cells contract and relax to cause\nmovement, nerve cells carry messages, blood\nflows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and\nwaste material and so on. In plants, vascular\ntissues conduct food and water from one part\nof the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular\norganisms show division of labour. Cells\nspecialising in one function are often grouped\ntogether in the body. This means that a\nparticular function is carried out by a cluster\nof cells at a definite place in the body. This\ncluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and\ndesigned so as to give the highest possible\nefficiency of function. Blood, phloem and\nmuscle are all examples of tissues.\nA group of cells that are similar in structure\nand/or work together to achieve a particular\nfunction forms a tissue.\n6.1 Are Plants and Animals Made\nof Same Types of Tissues?\nLet us compare their structure and functions.\nDo plants and animals have the same\nstructure? Do they both perform similar\nfunctions?\nThere are noticeable differences between\nthe two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they\ndon’t move. Since they have to be upright, they\nhave a large quantity of supportive tissue. The\nsupportive tissue generally has dead cells.\nAnimals on the other hand move around\nin search of food, mates and shelter. They\nconsume more energy as compared to plants.\nMost of the tissues they contain are living.\nAnother difference between animals and\nplants is in the pattern of growth. The growth\nin plants is limited to certain regions, while this\nis not so in animals. There are some tissues in\nplants that divide throughout their life. These\ntissues are localised in certain regions. Based\non the dividing capacity of the tissues, various\nplant tissues can be classified as growing or\nmeristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell\ngrowth in animals is more uniform. So, there\nis no such demarcation of dividing and non-\ndividing regions in animals.\nThe structural organisation of organs and\norgan systems is far more specialised and\nlocalised in complex animals than even in very\ncomplex plants. This fundamental difference\nreflects the different modes of life pursued by\nthese two major groups of organisms,\nparticularly in their different feeding methods.\nAlso, they are differently adapted for a\nsedentary existence on one hand (plants) and\nactive locomotion on the other (animals),\ncontributing to this difference in organ system\ndesign.\nIt is with reference to these complex animal\nand plant bodies that we will now talk about\nthe concept of tissues in some detail.\n6\nTISSUES\nISSUES\nISSUES\nISSUES\nISSUES\nC hapter\nReprint 2025-26"

For example, it\ncarries oxygen and food to all cells. It also\ncollects wastes from all parts of the body and\ncarries them to the liver and kidney for\ndisposal.\nBlood and muscles are both examples of\ntissues found in our body. On the basis of  the\nfunctions they perform we can think of different\ntypes of animal tissues, such as epithelial\ntissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and\nnervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective\ntissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue.\n6.3.1 EPITHELIAL TISSUE\nThe covering or protective tissues in the animal\nbody are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers\nmost organs and cavities within the body. It\nalso forms a barrier to keep different body\nsystems separate. The skin, the lining of the\nmouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli\nand kidney tubules are all made of epithelial\ntissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed\nand form a continuous sheet. They have only\na small amount of cementing material between\nthem and almost no intercellular spaces.\nObviously, anything entering or leaving the\nbody must cross at least one layer of\nepithelium. As a result, the permeability of the\ncells of various epithelia play an important role\nin regulating the exchange of materials\nbetween the body and the external\nenvironment and also between different parts\nof the body. Regardless of the type, all\nepithelium is usually separated from the\nunderlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous\nbasement membrane.\nDifferent epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing\nstructures that correlate with their unique\nfunctions.

Since they are arranged\nin a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called\nstratified squamous epithelium.\nWhere absorption and secretion occur, as\nin the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial\ncells are present. This columnar (meaning\n‘pillar-like’) epithelium facilitates movement\nacross the epithelial barrier. In the respiratory\ntract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has\ncilia, which are hair-like projections on the\nouter surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can\nmove, and their movement pushes the mucus\nforward to clear it.

To\ndescribe distance we need to specify only the\nnumerical value and not the direction of\nmotion. There are certain quantities which\nare described by specifying only their\nnumerical values. The numerical value of a\nphysical quantity is its magnitude. From this\nexample, can you find out the distance of the\nfinal position C of the object from the initial\nposition O? This difference will give you the\nnumerical value of the displacement of the\nobject from O to C through A. The shortest\ndistance measured from the initial to the final\nposition of an object is known as\nthe displacement.\nCan the magnitude of the displacement be\nequal to the distance travelled by an object?\nConsider the example given in (Fig. 7.1).

Further, we will notice that the\nmagnitude of the displacement for a course of\nmotion may be zero but the corresponding\ndistance covered is not zero. If we consider the\nobject to travel back to O, the final position\nconcides with the initial position, and therefore,\nthe displacement is zero.

    "text": "MOTION\n75\nLook at the situations given in Fig. 7.2. If\nthe bowling speed is 143 km h–1 in Fig. 7.2(a)\nwhat does it mean? What do you understand\nfrom the signboard in Fig. 7.2(b)?\nDifferent objects may take different\namounts of time to cover a given distance.\nSome of them move fast and some move\nslowly. The rate at which objects move can\nbe different. Also, different objects can move\nat the same rate. One of the ways of\nmeasuring the rate of motion of an object is\nto find out the distance travelled by the object\nin unit time. This quantity is referred to as\nspeed. The SI unit of speed is metre per\nsecond. This is represented by the symbol\nm s–1 or m/s. The other units of speed include\ncentimetre per second (cm s–1) and kilometre\nper hour (km h–1). To specify the speed of an\nobject, we require only its magnitude. The\nspeed of an object need not be constant. In\nmost cases, objects will be in non-uniform\nmotion. Therefore, we describe the rate of\nmotion of such objects in terms of their\naverage speed. The average speed of an object\nis obtained by dividing the total distance\ntravelled by the total time taken. That is,\naverage speed = Total distance travelled\nTotal time taken\nIf an object travels a distance s in time t then\nits speed v is,\nv = s\nt\n(7.1)\nLet us understand this by an example. A\ncar travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its\naverage speed is 50 km h–1. The car might\nnot have travelled at 50 km h–1 all the time.\nSometimes it might have travelled faster and\nsometimes slower than this.\nExample 7.1 An object travels 16 m in 4 s\nand then another 16 m in 2 s. What is\nthe average speed of the object?\nSolution:\nTotal distance travelled by the object =\n16 m + 16 m = 32 m\nTotal time taken = 4 s + 2 s = 6 s\nAverage speed = \nTotal distance travelled\nTotal time taken\n= \n32 m\n6 s\n= 5.33 m s–1\nTherefore, the average speed of the object\nis 5.33 m s–1.\n7.2.1 SPEED WITH DIRECTION\nThe rate of motion of an object can be more\ncomprehensive if we specify its direction of\nmotion along with its speed. The quantity that\nspecifies both these aspects is called velocity.\nVelocity is the speed of an object moving in a\ndefinite direction. The velocity of an object\ncan be uniform or variable. It can be changed\nby changing the object’s speed, direction of\nmotion or both. When an object is moving\nalong a straight line at a variable speed, we\ncan express the magnitude of its rate of\nmotion in terms of average velocity. It is\ncalculated in the same way as we calculate\naverage speed.\nIn case the velocity of the object is\nchanging at a uniform rate, then average\nvelocity is given by the arithmetic mean of\ninitial velocity and final velocity for a given\nperiod of time. That is,\naverage velocity = initial velocity + final velocity\n2\nMathematically, v av  = \nu + v\n2\n(7.2)\nwhere vav is the average velocity, u is the initial\nvelocity and v is the final velocity of the object.\nSpeed and velocity have the same units,\nthat is, m s–1 or m/s.\nActivity ______________ 7.6\n•\nMeasure the time it takes you to walk\nfrom your house to your bus stop or\nthe school.

As\nyou have studied in mathematics, a straight\nline graph helps in solving a linear equation\nhaving two variables.\nTo describe the motion of an object, we\ncan use line graphs.

This shows that the\ndistance travelled by the object is directly\nproportional to time taken. Thus, for uniform\nspeed, a graph of distance travelled against\ntime is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3.\nThe portion OB of the graph shows that the\ndistance is increasing at a uniform rate. Note\nthat, you can also use the term uniform\nvelocity in place of uniform speed if you take\nthe magnitude of displacement equal to the\ndistance travelled by the object along the\ny-axis.\nWe can use the distance-time graph to\ndetermine the speed of an object. To do so,\nconsider a small part AB of the distance-time\ngraph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel\nto the x-axis from point A and another line\nparallel to the y-axis from point B.

It balances the\npushing force and therefore the box does not\nmove. In Fig. 8.4(b), the children push the box\nharder but the box still does not move.

He observed that when a marble\nrolls down an inclined plane, its velocity\nincreases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter, you\nwill learn that the marble falls under the\nunbalanced force of gravity as it rolls down\nand attains a definite velocity by the time it\nreaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases\nwhen it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b).\nFig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal\nfrictionless plane inclined on both sides.\nGalileo argued that when the marble is\nreleased from left, it would roll down the slope\nand go up on the opposite side to the same\nheight from which it was released. If the\ninclinations of the planes on both sides are\nequal then the marble will climb the same\ndistance that it covered while rolling down. If\nthe angle of inclination of the right-side plane\nwere gradually decreased, then the marble\nwould travel further distances till it reaches\nthe original height. If the right-side plane were\nultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope\nis reduced to zero), the marble would continue\nto travel forever trying to reach the same\nheight that it was released from. The\nunbalanced forces on the marble in this case\nare zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced\n(external) force is required to change the\nmotion of the marble but no net force is\nneeded to sustain the uniform motion of the\nmarble.  In practical situations it is difficult\nto achieve a zero unbalanced force. This is\nbecause of the presence of the frictional force\nacting opposite to the direction of motion.\nThus, in practice the marble stops after\ntravelling some distance. The effect of the\nfrictional force may be minimised by using a\nsmooth marble and a smooth plane and\nproviding a lubricant on top of the planes.\nFig. 8.5: (a) the downward motion; (b) the upward\nmotion of a marble on an inclined plane;\nand (c) on a double inclined plane.\nNewton further studied Galileo’s ideas on\nforce and motion and presented three\nfundamental laws that govern the motion of\nobjects. These three laws are known as\nNewton’s laws of motion. The first law of\nmotion is stated as:\nAn object remains in a state of rest or of\nuniform motion in a straight line unless\ncompelled to change that state by an\napplied force.\nIn other words, all objects resist a change\nin their state of motion. In a qualitative way,\nthe tendency of undisturbed objects to stay\nat rest or to keep moving with the same\nvelocity is called inertia. This is why, the first\nlaw of motion is also known as the law\nof inertia.\nCertain experiences that we come across\nwhile travelling in a motorcar can be\nexplained on the basis of the law of inertia.\nWe tend to remain at rest with respect to the\nseat until the driver applies a braking force\nto stop the motorcar. With the application of\nbrakes, the car slows down but our body\ntends to continue in the same state of motion\nbecause of its inertia. A sudden application of\nbrakes may thus cause injury to us by impact\nReprint 2025-26"

This is because the\nsudden start of the bus brings motion to the\nbus as well as to our feet in contact with the\nfloor of the bus. But the rest of our body\nopposes this motion because of its inertia.\nWhen a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a\nhigh speed, we tend to get thrown to one side.\nThis can again be explained on the basis of\nthe law of inertia. We tend to continue in our\nstraight-line motion. When an unbalanced\nforce is applied by the engine to change the\ndirection of motion of the motorcar, we slip to\none side of the seat due to the inertia of\nour body.\nThe fact that a body will remain at rest\nunless acted upon by an unbalanced force\ncan \nbe \nillustrated \nthrough \nthe\nfollowing activities:\nActivity ______________ 8.1\n•\nMake a pile of similar carom coins on\na table, as shown in Fig. 8.6.\n•\nAttempt  a sharp horizontal hit at the\nbottom of the pile using another carom\ncoin or the striker.

Once the lowest coin is\nremoved, the inertia of the other coins\nmakes them ‘fall’ vertically on the\ntable.\nGalileo Galilei was born\non 15 February 1564 in\nPisa, Italy. Galileo, right\nfrom his childhood, had\ninterest in mathematics\nand natural philosophy.\nBut \nhis \nfather\nVincenzo Galilei wanted\nhim to become a medical\ndoctor. \nAccordingly,\nGalileo enrolled himself\nfor a medical degree at the\nUniversity of Pisa in 1581 which he never\ncompleted because of his real interest in\nmathematics. In 1586, he wrote his first\nscientific book ‘The Little Balance [La\nBalancitta]’, in which he described\nArchimedes’ method of finding the relative\ndensities (or specific gravities) of substances\nusing a balance. In 1589, in his series of\nessays – De Motu, he presented his theories\nabout falling objects using an inclined plane\nto slow down the rate of descent.\nIn 1592, he was appointed professor of\nmathematics at the University of Padua in\nthe Republic of Venice. Here he continued his\nobservations on the theory of motion and\nthrough his study of inclined planes and the\npendulum, formulated the correct law for\nuniformly accelerated objects that the\ndistance the object moves is proportional to\nthe square of the time taken.\nGalileo was also a remarkable craftsman.\nHe developed a series of telescopes whose\noptical performance was much better than\nthat of other telescopes available during those\ndays. Around 1640, he designed the first\npendulum clock. In his book ‘Starry\nMessenger’ on his astronomical discoveries,\nGalileo claimed to have seen mountains on\nthe moon, the milky way made up of tiny\nstars, and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter.\nIn his books ‘Discourse on Floating Bodies’\nand ‘Letters on the Sunspots’, he disclosed\nhis observations of sunspots.\nUsing his own telescopes and through his\nobservations on Saturn and Venus, Galileo\nargued that all the planets must orbit the Sun\nand not the earth, contrary to what was\nbelieved at that time.\nGalileo Galilei\n(1564 – 1642)\nFig. 8.6: Only the carom coin at the bottom of a\npile is removed when a fast moving carom\ncoin (or striker) hits it.\nReprint 2025-26"

This is because, in comparison to the\ncart the train has a much lesser tendency to\nchange its state of motion. Accordingly, we say\nthat the train has more inertia than the cart.\nClearly, heavier or more massive objects offer\nlarger inertia. Quantitatively, the inertia of an\nobject is measured by its mass.

We would now like to study how\nthe acceleration of an object depends on the\nforce applied to it and how we measure a force.\nLet us recount some observations from our\neveryday life. During the game of table tennis\nif the ball hits a player it does not hurt him.\nOn the other hand, when a fast moving cricket\nball hits a spectator, it may hurt him. A truck\nat rest does not require any attention when\nparked along a roadside. But a moving truck,\neven at speeds as low as 5 m s–1, may kill a\nperson standing in its path. A small mass,\nsuch as a bullet may kill a person when fired\nfrom a gun. These observations suggest that\nthe impact produced by the objects depends\non their mass and velocity. Similarly, if an\nobject is to be accelerated, we know that a\ngreater force is required to give a greater\nvelocity. In other words, there appears to exist\nsome quantity of importance that combines\nthe object’s mass and its velocity. One such\nproperty called momentum was introduced by\nNewton. The momentum, p of an object is\ndefined as the product of its mass, m and\nvelocity, v. That is,\np = mv\n(8.1)\nMomentum has both direction and\nmagnitude. Its direction is the same as that\nof velocity, v. The SI unit of momentum is\nkilogram-metre per second (kg m s-1). Since\nthe application of an unbalanced force brings\na change in the velocity of the object, it is\ntherefore clear that a force also produces a\nchange of momentum.\nLet us consider a situation in which a car\nwith a dead battery is to be pushed along a\nstraight road to give it a speed of 1 m s-1, which\nis sufficient to start its engine. If one or two\npersons give a sudden push (unbalanced force)\nto it, it hardly starts. But a continuous push\nover some time results in a gradual acceleration\nof the car to this speed. It means that the change\nof momentum of the car is not only determined\nby the magnitude of the force but also by the\ntime during which the force is exerted. It may\nthen also be concluded that the force necessary\nto change the momentum of an object depends\non the time rate at which the momentum is\nchanged.\nThe second law of motion states that the\nrate of change of momentum of an object is\nproportional to the applied unbalanced force\nin the direction of force.\n8.4.1 MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF\nSECOND LAW OF MOTION\nSuppose an object of mass, m is moving along\na straight line with an initial velocity, u. It is\nuniformly accelerated to velocity, v in time, t\nby the application of a constant force, F\nthroughout the time, t. The initial and final\nmomentum of the object will be, p1 = mu and\np2 = mv respectively.\nThe change in momentum\n∝p2 – p1\n∝mv – mu\n∝m × (v – u).\nThe rate of change of momentum ∝\n(\n)\n×\n−\nm\nv\nu\nt\nOr, the applied force,\nF ∝ \n(\n)\n×\n−\nm\nv\nu\nt\n(\n)\n×\n−\n= km\nv\nu\nt\nF\n(8.2)\n=  k m a\n (8.3)\nHere a ∝ = [(v – u)/t] is the acceleration,\nwhich is the rate of change of velocity.

Have you noticed\nthat while catching a fast moving cricket ball,\na fielder in the ground gradually pulls his\nhands backwards with the moving ball? In\ndoing so, the fielder increases the time during\nwhich the high velocity of the moving ball\ndecreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of\nthe ball is decreased and therefore the impact\nof catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 8.8) is\nalso reduced. If the ball is stopped suddenly\nthen its high velocity decreases to zero in a\nvery short interval of time. Thus, the rate of\nchange of momentum of the ball will be large.\nTherefore, a large force would have to be\napplied for holding the catch that may hurt\nthe palm of the fielder. In a high jump athletic\nevent, the athletes are made to fall either on\na cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to\nincrease the time of the athlete’s fall to stop\nafter making the jump. This decreases the rate\nof change of momentum and hence the force.\nTry to ponder how a karate player breaks a\nslab of ice with a single blow.\nThe first law of motion can be\nmathematically stated from the mathematical\nexpression for the second law of motion.

These two forces are always\nequal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\nThese forces act on different objects and never\non the same object. In the game of football\nsometimes we, while looking at the football\nand trying to kick it with a greater force,\ncollide with a player of the opposite team.\nBoth feel hurt because each applies a force\nto the other. In other words, there is a pair of\nforces and not just one force. The two\nopposing forces are also known as action and\nreaction forces.\nLet us consider two spring balances\nconnected together as shown in Fig. 8.10. The\nfixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid\nsupport, like a wall. When a force is applied\nthrough the free end of spring balance A, it is\nobserved that both the spring balances show\nthe same readings on their scales. It means\nthat the force exerted by spring balance A on\nbalance B is equal but opposite in direction\nto the force exerted by the balance B on\nbalance A. Any of these two forces can be called\nas action and the other as reaction. This gives\nus an alternative statement of the third law of\nmotion i.e., to every action there is an equal\nand opposite reaction. However, it must be\nremembered that the action and reaction\nalways act on two different objects,\nsimultaneously.\nFig. 8.10: Action and reaction forces are equal and\nopposite.\nSuppose you are standing at rest and\nintend to start walking on a road. You must\naccelerate, and this requires a force in\naccordance with the second law of motion.\nWhich is this force? Is it the muscular effort\nyou exert on the road? Is it in the direction\nwe intend to move? No, you push the road\nbelow backwards. The road exerts an equal\nand opposite force on your feet to make you\nmove forward.\nIt is important to note that even though\nthe action and reaction forces are always\nequal in magnitude, these forces may not\nproduce accelerations of equal magnitudes.\nThis is because each force acts on a different\nobject that may have a different mass.\nWhen a gun is fired, it exerts a forward\nforce on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal\nand opposite force on the gun. This results in\nthe recoil of the gun (Fig. 8.11). Since the gun\nhas a much greater mass than the bullet, the\nacceleration of the gun is much less than the\nacceleration of the bullet. The third law of\nmotion can also be illustrated when a sailor\njumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor\njumps forward, the force on the boat moves it\nbackwards (Fig. 8.12).\nFig. 8.11: A forward force on the bullet and recoil\nof the gun.\nReprint 2025-26"

The force is along the line\njoining the centres of two objects.\nIn the absence of this force, the stone flies off\nalong a straight line. This straight line will be\na tangent to the circular path.\nMore to  know\nTangent to a circle\nA straight line that meets the circle at\none and only one point is called a\ntangent to the circle. Straight line\nABC is a tangent to the circle at\npoint B.\nThe motion of the moon around the earth\nis due to the centripetal force. The centripetal\nforce is provided by the force of attraction of\nthe earth. If there were no such force, the\nmoon would pursue a uniform straight line\nmotion.\nIt is seen that a falling apple is attracted\ntowards the earth. Does the apple attract the\nearth? If so, we do not see the earth moving\ntowards an apple. Why?\nAccording to the third law of motion, the\napple does attract the earth. But according\nto the second law of motion, for a given force,\nacceleration is inversely proportional to the\nmass of an object [Eq. (8.4)]. The mass of an\napple is negligibly small compared to that of\nthe earth. So, we do not see the earth moving\ntowards the apple. Extend the same argument\nfor why the earth does not move towards the\nmoon.\nIn our solar system, all the planets go\naround the Sun. By arguing the same way,\nwe can say that there exists a force between\nthe Sun and the planets.

This can be achieved by\nan externally applied force acting downwards.\nThis force must at least be equal to the\ndifference between the upward force and the\nweight of the bottle.\nThe upward force exerted by the water on\nthe bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant\nforce.

Have you ever drawn water from a\nwell and felt that the bucket of water is heavier\nwhen it is out of the water? Have you ever\nwondered why a ship made of iron and steel\ndoes not sink in sea water, but while the same\namount of iron and steel in the form of a sheet\nwould sink? These questions can be answered\nby taking buoyancy in consideration. Let us\nunderstand the meaning of buoyancy by\ndoing an activity.\nActivity ______________ 9.4\n•\nTake an empty plastic bottle. Close\nthe mouth of the bottle with an\nairtight stopper. Put it in a bucket\nfilled with water. You see that the\nbottle floats.\n•\nPush the bottle into the water. You feel\nan upward push. Try to push it further\ndown. You will find it difficult to push\ndeeper and deeper. This indicates that\nwater exerts a force on the bottle in the\nupward direction. The upward force\nexerted by the water goes on increasing\nas the bottle is pushed deeper  till it is\ncompletely immersed.\n•\nNow, release the  bottle. It bounces\nback to the surface.\n•\nDoes the force due to the gravitational\nattraction of the earth act on this\nbottle? If so, why doesn’t the bottle stay\nimmersed in water after it is released?\nHow can you immerse the bottle in\nwater?\nThe force due to the gravitational\nattraction of the earth acts on the bottle in\nthe downward direction. So the bottle is\npulled downwards. But the water exerts an\nupward force on the bottle. Thus, the bottle is\npushed upwards. We have learnt that weight\nof an object is the force due to gravitational\nattraction of the earth.

However,\nno further change is observed once the stone\ngets fully immersed in the water. What do you\ninfer from the decrease in the extension of the\nstring or the reading of the spring balance?\nWe know that the elongation produced in\nthe string or the spring balance is due to the\nweight of the stone.

As a result, the net force on\nthe string decreases and hence the elongation\nalso decreases.

This\nhappens because of the difference in their\ndensities. The density of a substance is\ndefined as the mass per unit volume. The\ndensity of cork is less than the density of\nwater. This means that the upthrust of water\non the cork is greater than the weight of the\ncork. So it floats (Fig. 9.5).\nThe density of an iron nail is more than\nthe density of water. This means that the\nupthrust of water on the iron nail is less than\nthe weight of the nail. So it sinks.\nTherefore objects of density less than that\nof a liquid float on the liquid.

Living beings\nhave to perform several basic activities to\nsurvive.  We call such activities ‘life processes’.\nThe energy for these processes comes from\nfood. We need energy for other activities like\nplaying, singing, reading, writing, thinking,\njumping, cycling and running.  Activities that\nare strenuous require more energy.\nAnimals too get engaged in activities.  For\nexample, they may jump and run.  They have\nto fight, move away from enemies, find food\nor find a safe place to live. Also, we engage\nsome animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull\ncarts or plough fields.  All such activities\nrequire energy.\nThink of machines. List the machines that\nyou have come across. What do they need for\ntheir working? Why do some engines require\nfuel like petrol and diesel?  Why do living\nbeings and machines need energy?\n10.1 Work\nWhat is work? There is a difference in the\nway we use the term ‘work’ in day-to-day life\nand the way we use it in science.  To make\nthis point clear let us consider a few examples.\n10.1.1 NOT MUCH ‘WORK’ IN SPITE OF\nWORKING HARD!\nKamali is preparing for examinations. She\nspends lot of time in studies. She reads books,\ndraws diagrams, organises her thoughts,\ncollects question papers, attends classes,\ndiscusses problems with her friends, and\nperforms experiments.  She expends a lot of\nenergy on these activities. In common\nparlance, she is ‘working hard’. All this ‘hard\nwork’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by\nthe scientific definition of work.\nYou are working hard to push a huge rock.\nLet us say the rock does not move despite all\nthe effort. You get completely exhausted.\nHowever, you have not done any work on the\nrock as there is no displacement of the rock.\nYou stand still for a few minutes with a\nheavy load on your head.   You get tired. You\nhave exerted yourself and have spent quite a\nbit of your energy. Are you doing work on the\nload?  The way we understand the term ‘work’\nin science, work is not done.\nYou climb up the steps of a staircase and\nreach the second floor of a building just to\nsee the landscape from there.  You may even\nclimb up a tall tree.  If we apply the scientific\ndefinition, these activities involve a lot of work.\nIn day-to-day life, we consider any useful\nphysical or mental labour as work. Activities\nlike playing in a field, talking with friends,\nhumming a tune, watching a movie, attending\na function are sometimes not considered to\nbe work.  What constitutes ‘work’ depends\non the way we define it. We use and define\nthe term work differently in science.

To\nunderstand this, we shall first consider the\ncase when the force is acting in the direction\nof displacement.\nLet a constant force, F act on an object.\nLet the object be displaced through a\ndistance, s in the direction of the force (Fig.\n10.1).

The\npebble moves through a distance. You exerted\na force on the pebble and the pebble got\ndisplaced. In this situation work is done.\nA girl pulls a trolley and the trolley moves\nthrough a distance.  The girl has exerted a\nforce on the trolley and it is displaced.\nTherefore, work is done.\nLift a book through a height. To do this\nyou must apply a force.  The book rises up.\nThere is a force applied on the book and the\nbook has moved.  Hence, work is done.\nA closer look at the above situations\nreveals that two conditions need to be\nsatisfied for work to be done: (i) a force should\nact on an object, and (ii) the object must be\ndisplaced.\nIf any one of the above conditions does\nnot exist, work is not done. This is the way\nwe view work in science.\nA bullock is pulling a cart.  The cart\nmoves. There is a force on the cart and the\ncart has moved.

Work has only\nmagnitude and no direction.\nIn Eq. (10.1), if F = 1 N and s = 1 m then\nthe work done by the force will be 1 N m.\nHere the unit of work is newton metre (N m)\nor joule  (J).

Refer\nto the conditions that are to be satisfied to\nsay that work is done.\nExample 10.1 A force of 5 N is acting on\nan object.

This is because work is\ndone on it against gravity while it is being\nraised. The energy present in such an object\nis the gravitational potential energy.\nThe gravitational potential energy of an\nobject at a point above the ground is defined\nas the work done in raising it from the ground\nto that point against gravity.\nIt is easy to arrive at an expression for\nthe gravitational potential energy of an object\nat a height.\nFig. 10.7\nConsider an object of mass, m. Let it be\nraised through a height, h from the ground.\nA force is required to do this. The minimum\nforce required to raise the object is equal to\nthe weight of the object, mg. The object gains\nenergy equal to the work done on it.  Let the\nwork done on the object against gravity be\nW. That is,\nwork done, W = force × displacement\n= mg × h\n= mgh\nSince work done on the object is equal to\nmgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained\nby the object. This is the potential energy (EP)\nof the object.\nEp = mgh\n(10.6)\nMore to know\nThe potential energy of an object at\na height depends on the ground level\nor the zero level you choose.  An\nobject in a given position can have a\ncertain potential energy with respect\nto one level and a different value of\npotential energy with respect to\nanother level.\nIt is useful to note that the work done by\ngravity depends on the difference in vertical\nheights of the initial and final positions of\nthe object and not on the path along which\nthe object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case\nwhere a block is raised from position A to B\nby taking two different paths. Let the height\nAB = h. In both the situations the work done\non the object is mgh.\nFig. 10.8\nExample 10.5 Find the energy possessed\nby an object of mass 10 kg when it is at\na height of 6 m above the ground.

What happens to the total\nenergy of a system during or after the process?\nWhenever energy gets transformed, the total\nenergy remains unchanged. This is the law of\nconservation of energy. According to this law,\nenergy can only be converted from one form\nto another; it can neither be created or\ndestroyed. The total energy before and after\nthe transformation remains the same. The law\nof conservation of energy is valid                  in\nall situations and for all kinds of\ntransformations.\nConsider a simple example. Let an object\nof mass, m be made to fall freely from a     height,\nh. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and\nkinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic\nenergy zero? It is zero because its velocity is\nzero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh.\nAs it falls, its potential energy will change into\nkinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object\nat a given instant, the kinetic energy would be\n½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the\npotential energy would decrease while the\nkinetic energy would increase. When the object\nis about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will\nbe the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy\nwould be the largest and potential energy the\nleast.  However, the sum of the potential energy\nand kinetic energy of the object would be the\nsame at all points. That is,\npotential energy + kinetic energy = constant\n   or\n1\nconstant.\n2\n2\nmgh +\nmv =\n(10.7)\nThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy\nof an object is its total mechanical energy.\nWe find that during the free fall of the object,\nthe decrease in potential energy, at any point\nin its path, appears as an equal amount of\nincrease in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of\nair resistance on the motion of the object has\nbeen ignored.) There is thus a continual\ntransformation of gravitational potential\nenergy into kinetic energy.\nReprint 2025-26"

It then exerts a force on the adjacent\nparticle. As a result of which the adjacent\nparticle gets displaced from its position of\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\nfirst particle comes back to its original\nposition. This process continues in the\nmedium till the sound reaches your ear. The\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\nthe medium travels through the medium and\nnot the particles of the medium.\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\nmotion. They in turn produce similar motion\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\nmove forward themselves, but the\ndisturbance is carried forward. This is what\nhappens during propagation of sound in a\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\nmotion of particles in the medium and are\ncalled mechanical waves.\nAir is the most common medium through\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\nair in front of it creating a region of high\npressure. This region is called a compression\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwards,\nit creates a region of low pressure called\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\nof compressions and rarefactions is created in\nthe air. These make the sound wave that\nFig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning\nfork dipped in water\nFrom the above activities what do you\nconclude? Can you produce sound without\na vibrating object?\nIn the above activities we have produced\nsound by striking the tuning fork. We can\nalso produce sound by plucking, scratching,\nrubbing, blowing or shaking different objects.\nAs per the above activities what do we do to\nthe objects? We set the objects vibrating and\nproduce sound. Vibration means a kind of\nrapid to and fro motion of an object. The\nsound of the human voice is produced due\nto vibrations in the vocal cords. When a bird\nflaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think\nhow the buzzing sound accompanying a bee\nis produced. A stretched rubber band when\nplucked vibrates and produces sound. If you\nhave never done this, then do it and observe\nthe vibration of the stretched rubber band.\nActivity _____________11.3\n•\nMake a list of different types of\nmusical instruments and discuss\nwith your friends which part of the\ninstrument vibrates to produce\nsound.\n11.2 Propagation of Sound\nSound is produced by vibrating objects. The\nmatter or substance through which sound\nis transmitted is called a medium. It can be\nsolid, liquid or gas. Sound moves through a\nmedium from the point of generation to the\nlistener. When an object vibrates, it sets the\nparticles of the medium around it vibrating.\nThe particles do not travel all the way from\nFig. 11.4:\nA vibrating object creating a series of\ncompressions (C) and rarefactions (R) in\nthe medium.\nReprint 2025-26"

More density\nof the particles in the medium gives more\npressure and vice versa. Thus, propagation\nof sound can be visualised as propagation of\ndensity variations or pressure variations in\nthe medium.\nuestion\n1.\nHow does the sound produced by\na vibrating object in a medium\nreach your ear?\n2.\nExplain how sound is produced\nby your school bell.\n3.\nWhy are sound waves called\nmechanical waves?\n4.\nSuppose you and your friend are\non the moon.

You hold the other end.\nNow stretch the slinky as shown in\nFig. 11.5(a). Then give it a sharp push\ntowards your friend.\n•\nWhat do you notice? If you move your\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\nalternatively, what will you observe?\n•\nIf you mark a dot on the slinky, you\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\nwill move back and forth parallel to\nthe direction of the propagation of the\ndisturbance.\nThe regions where the coils become closer\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\npropagates in the medium as a series of\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\nThe particles do not move from one place to\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\nforth about their position of rest. This is\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\nThere is also another type of wave, called\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\nthe individual particles of the medium move\nabout their mean positions in a direction\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\nare not of the medium particles or their\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\nwave. You will come to know more about\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND\nWAVE\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\n•\nfrequency\n•\namplitude and\n•\nspeed.\nQ\nA sound wave in graphic form is shown in\nFig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and\npressure change when the sound wave moves\nin the medium.

The\nfaster the vibration of the source, the\nhigher is the frequency and the higher is\nthe pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a\nhigh pitch sound corresponds to more\nnumber of compressions and rarefactions\npassing a fixed point per unit time.\nObjects of different sizes and conditions\nvibrate at different frequencies to produce\nsounds of different pitch.\nThe magnitude of the maximum\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,\nas shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit\nwill be that of density or pressure.\nThe loudness or softness of a sound is\ndetermined basically by its amplitude. The\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\nthe force with which an object is made to\nvibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wave\ndensity of the medium oscillates between a\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\nchange in density from the maximum value\nto the minimum value, then again to the\nmaximum value, makes one complete\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\nwave. If we can count the number of the\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\nn (Greek letter, nu). Its SI unit is hertz\n(symbol, Hz).\nThe time taken by two consecutive\ncompressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed\npoint is called the time period of the wave.

Both sounds\ntravel through the same medium, that is, air\nand arrive at our ear at the same time. Both\nsounds travel at the same speed irrespective\nof the source.

Like light, sound\ngets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid\nand follows the same laws of reflection as you\nhave studied in earlier classes. The directions\nin which the sound is incident and is reflected\nmake equal angles with the normal to the\nreflecting surface at the point of incidence, and\nthe three are in the same plane.

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\nthe medium through which it travels. You will\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\nm s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC.

This sound which we\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\nbetween the original sound and the\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\ngiven temperature, say at 22 ºC in air, the\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\nthe sound from the point of generation to\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\nsound must be half of this distance, that\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\nthe temperature of air. Echoes may be heard\nmore than once due to successive or\nmultiple reflections.

The repeated reflection that\nresults in this persistence of sound is\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\nExample 11.2 A person clapped his hands\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.\nWhat is the distance of the cliff from the\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\nSolution:\nGiven,\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\nt = 2 s\nDistance travelled by the sound\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\ndistance between the cliff and the\nperson.

We obtain most of this food\nfrom agriculture and animal husbandry.\nWe read in newspapers that efforts are\nalways being made to improve production\nfrom agriculture and animal husbandry. Why\nis this necessary? Why we cannot make do\nwith the current levels of production?\nIndia is a very populous country. Our\npopulation is more than one billion people,\nand it is still growing. As food for this growing\npopulation, we will soon need more than a\nquarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year.\nThis can be done by farming on more land.\nBut India is already intensively cultivated. As\na result, we do not have any major scope for\nincreasing the area of land under cultivation.\nTherefore, it is necessary to increase our\nproduction efficiency for both crops and\nlivestock.\nEfforts to meet the food demand by\nincreasing food production have led to some\nsuccesses so far. We have had the green\nrevolution, which contributed to increased\nfood-grain production. We have also had the\nwhite revolution, which has led to better and\nmore efficient use as well as availability of milk.\nHowever, these revolutions mean that our\nnatural resources are getting used more\nintensively. As a result, there are more\nchances of causing damage to our natural\nresources to the point of destroying their\nbalance completely. Therefore, it is important\nthat we should increase food production\nwithout degrading our environment and\ndisturbing the balances maintaining it. Hence,\nthere is a need for sustainable practices in\nagriculture and animal husbandry.\nAlso, simply increasing grain production\nfor storage in warehouses cannot solve the\nproblem of malnutrition and hunger. People\nshould have money to purchase food. Food\nsecurity depends on both availability of food\nand access to it. The majority of our\npopulation depends on agriculture for their\nlivelihood. Increasing the incomes of people\nworking in agriculture is therefore necessary\nto combat the problem of hunger. Scientific\nmanagement practices should be undertaken\nto obtain high yields from farms. For\nsustained livelihood, one should undertake\nmixed farming, intercropping, and integrated\nfarming practices, for example, combine\nagriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/\nbee-keeping.\nThe question thus becomes – how do we\nincrease the yields of crops and livestock?\n12.1 Improvement in Crop Yields\nCereals such as wheat, rice, maize, millets and\nsorghum provide us carbohydrate for energy\nrequirement. Pulses like gram (chana), pea\n(matar), black gram (urad), green gram (moong),\npigeon pea (arhar), lentil (masoor), provide us with\nprotein. And oil seeds including soyabean,\nground nut, sesame, castor, mustard, linseed and\nsunflower provide us with necessary fats (Fig.\n12.1). Vegetables, spices and fruits provide a\nrange of vitamins and minerals in addition to\nsmall amounts of proteins, carbohydrates and\nfats. In addition to these food crops, fodder crops\nlike berseem, oats or sudan grass are raised as\nfood for the livestock.\n12\nIMPROVEMENT\nMPROVEMENT\nMPROVEMENT\nMPROVEMENT\nMPROVEMENT IN\nIN\nIN\nIN\nIN F\n F\n F\n F\n FOOD\nOOD\nOOD\nOOD\nOOD R\n R\n R\n R\n RESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nC hapter\nReprint 2025-26"

Paddy, soyabean, pigeon\npea, maize, cotton, green gram and black\ngram are kharif crops, whereas wheat, gram,\npeas, mustard, linseed are rabi crops.\nIn India there has been a four times\nincrease in the production of food grains from\n1952 to 2010 with only 25% increase in the\ncultivable land area. How has this increase\nin production been achieved? If we think of\nthe practices involved in farming, we can see\nthat we can divide it into three stages. The\nfirst is the choice of seeds for planting. The\nsecond is the nurturing of the crop plants.\nThe third is the protection of the growing and\nharvested crops from loss. Thus, the major\ngroups of activities for improving crop yields\ncan be classified as:\n•\nCrop variety improvement\n•\nCrop production improvement\n•\nCrop protection management.\n12.1.1 CROP VARIETY IMPROVEMENT\nThis approach depends on finding a crop\nvariety that can give a good yield. Varieties or\nstrains of crops can be selected by breeding\nfor various useful characteristics such as\ndisease resistance, response to fertilisers,\nproduct quality and high yields. One way of\nincorporating desirable characters into crop\nvarieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation\nrefers to crossing between genetically\ndissimilar plants. This crossing may be\nintervarietal (between different varieties),\ninterspecific (between two different species of\nthe same genus) or intergeneric (between\ndifferent genera). Another way of improving\nthe crop is by introducing a gene that would\nprovide the desired characteristic. This\nresults in genetically modified crops.\nFor new varieties of crops to be accepted,\nit is necessary that the variety produces high\nyields under different conditions that are\nfound in different areas. Farmers would need\nto be provided with good quality seeds of a\nparticular variety, that is, the seeds should all\nFig. 12.1: Different types of crops\nuestion\n1.\nWhat do we get from cereals,\npulses, fruits and vegetables?\nDifferent crops require different climatic\nconditions, temperature and photoperiods for\ntheir growth and completion of their life cycle.\nPhotoperiods are related to the duration of\nsunlight.

Since weather conditions such as\ndrought \nand \nflood \nsituations \nare\nunpredictable, varieties that can be grown in\ndiverse climatic conditions are useful.\nSimilarly, varieties tolerant to high soil salinity\nhave been developed. Some of the factors for\nwhich variety improvement is done are:\n•\nHigher yield: To increase the\nproductivity of the crop per acre.\n•\nImproved \nquality: \nQuality\nconsiderations of crop products vary\nfrom crop to crop. Baking quality is\nimportant in wheat, protein quality in\npulses, oil quality in oilseeds and\npreserving quality in fruits and\nvegetables.\n•\nBiotic and abiotic resistance: Crops\nproduction can go down due to biotic\n(diseases, insects and nematodes) and\nabiotic (drought, salinity, water\nlogging, heat, cold and frost) stresses\nunder different situations. Varieties\nresistant to these stresses can improve\ncrop production.\n•\nChange in maturity duration: The\nshorter the duration of the crop from\nsowing to harvesting, the more\neconomical is the variety. Such short\ndurations allow farmers to grow\nmultiple rounds of crops in a year.\nShort duration also reduces the cost\nof crop production. Uniform maturity\nmakes the harvesting process easy\nand reduces losses during harvesting.\n•\nWider adaptability: Developing\nvarieties for wider adaptability will\nhelp in stabilising the crop production\nunder different environmental\nconditions. One variety can then be\ngrown under different climatic\nconditions in different areas.\n•\nDesirable agronomic characteristics:\nTallness and profuse branching are\ndesirable characters for fodder crops.\nDwarfness is desired in cereals, so that\nless nutrients are consumed by these\ncrops. Thus developing varieties of\ndesired agronomic characters help give\nhigher productivity.\nuestions\n1.\nHow do biotic and abiotic factors\naffect crop production?\n2.\nWhat are the desirable agronomic\ncharacteristics \nfor \ncrop\nimprovements?\n12.1.2 CROP PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT\nIn India, as in many other agriculture-based\ncountries, farming ranges from small to very\nlarge farms. Different farmers thus have more\nor less land, money and access to information\nand technologies. In short, it is the money or\nfinancial conditions that allow farmers to take\nup different farming practices and agricultural\ntechnologies. There is a correlation between\nhigher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer’s\npurchasing capacity for inputs decides\ncropping system and production practices.\nTherefore, production practices can be at\ndifferent levels. They include ‘no cost’\nproduction, ‘low cost’ production and ‘high\ncost’ production practices.\n12.1.2 (i)  NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT\nJust as we need food for development, growth\nand well-being, plants also require nutrients\nfor growth. Nutrients are supplied to plants\nby air, water and soil. There are several\nnutrients which are essential for plants. Air\nsupplies carbon and oxygen, hydrogen comes\nfrom water, and soil supplies the other thirteen\nnutrients to plants. Amongst these, some are\nrequired in large quantities and are therefore\ncalled macro-nutrients. The other nutrients are\nused by plants in small quantities and are\ntherefore called micro-nutrients (Table 12.1).\nQ\nReprint 2025-26"

Based on\nthe kind of biological material used, manure\ncan be classified as:\n(i)\nCompost and vermi-compost: The\nprocess in which farm waste material\nlike livestock excreta (cow dung, etc.),\nvegetable waste, animal refuse,\ndomestic waste, sewage waste, straw,\neradicated weeds etc. is decomposed\nin pits is known as composting. The\ncompost is rich in organic matter and\nnutrients. Compost is also prepared\nby using earthworms to hasten the\nprocess of decomposition of plant and\nanimal refuse. This is called\nvermi-compost.\n(ii) Green manure: Prior to the sowing of\nthe crop seeds, some plants like sun\nhemp or guar are grown and then\nmulched by ploughing them into the\nsoil. These green plants thus turn into\ngreen manure which helps in\nenriching the soil in nitrogen\nand phosphorus.\nFERTILIZERS\nFertilizers are commercially produced plant\nnutrients. Fertilizers supply nitrogen,\nphosphorus and potassium. They are used\nto ensure good vegetative growth (leaves,\nbranches and flowers), giving rise to healthy\nplants.

For example, sometimes\nfertilizers get washed away due to excessive\nirrigation and are not fully absorbed by the\nplants. This excess fertilizer then leads to\nwater pollution.\nAlso, as we have seen in the previous class,\ncontinuous use of fertilizers in an area can\ndestroy soil fertility because the organic\nmatter in the soil is not replenished and\nmicro-organisms in the soil are harmed by the\nfertilizers used.

The bulk of organic matter in\nmanure helps in improving the soil structure.\nThis involves increasing the water holding\ncapacity in sandy soils.

Under such\nconditions, several different kinds of irrigation\nsystems are adopted to supply water to\nagricultural lands depending on the kinds of\nwater resources available. These include wells,\ncanals, rivers and tanks.\n•\nWells:  There are two types of wells,\nnamely dug wells and tube wells. In a\ndug well, water is collected from water\nbearing strata. Tube wells can tap\nwater from the deeper strata. From\nthese wells, water is lifted by pumps\nfor irrigation.\n•\nCanals: This is usually an elaborate\nand extensive irrigation system. In this\nsystem canals receive water from one\nor more reservoirs or from rivers. The\nmain canal is divided into branch\ncanals having further distributaries to\nirrigate fields.\n•\nRiver Lift Systems: In areas where\ncanal flow is insufficient or irregular\ndue to inadequate reservoir release,\nthe lift system is more rational. Water\nis directly drawn from the rivers for\nsupplementing irrigation in areas\nclose to rivers.\n•\nTanks: These are small storage\nreservoirs, which intercept and store\nthe run-off of smaller catchment\nareas.\nFresh initiatives for increasing the water\navailable for agriculture include rainwater\nharvesting and watershed management.

Infectious diseases\nare also caused by bacteria and viruses.\nVaccinations are given to farm animals\nagainst many major viral and bacterial\ndiseases.\n12.2.2 POULTRY FARMING\nPoultry farming is undertaken to raise\ndomestic fowl for egg production and chicken\nmeat. Therefore, improved poultry breeds are\ndeveloped and farmed to produce layers for\neggs and broilers for meat.\nThe cross-breeding programmes between\nIndian (indigenous, for example, Aseel) and\nforeign (exotic, for example, Leghorn) breeds\nfor variety improvement are focused on to\ndevelop new varieties for the following\ndesirable traits—\n(i)\nnumber and quality of chicks;\nQ\nFig. 12.3: Indigenous milch breed of cattle\nReprint 2025-26"

Observe\ntypes of breeds and note the type of\nration, housing and lighting facilities\ngiven to them. Identify the growers,\nlayers and broilers.\n12.2.3 FISH PRODUCTION\nFish is a cheap source of animal protein for\nour food. Fish production includes the finned\ntrue fish as well as shellfish such as prawns\nand molluscs. There are two ways of obtaining\nfish. One is from natural resources, which is\ncalled capture fishing. The other way is by\nfish farming, which is called culture fishery.\nThe water source of the fish can be either\nseawater or fresh water, such as in rivers and\nponds. Fishing can thus be done both by\ncapture and culture of fish in marine and\nfreshwater ecosystems.\n12.2.3 (i) MARINE FISHERIES\nIndia’s marine fishery resources include\n7500 km of coastline and the deep seas\nFig. 12.4\nAseel\nLeghorn\nuestion\n1.\nDiscuss the implications of the\nfollowing statement:\n“It is interesting to note that\npoultry is India’s most efficient\nconverter of low fibre food stuff\n(which is unfit for human\nconsumption) into highly\nnutritious animal protein food.”\nEGG AND BROILER PRODUCTION\nBroiler chickens are fed with vitamin-rich\nsupplementary feed for good growth rate and\nbetter feed efficiency. Care is taken to avoid\nmortality and to maintain feathering and\ncarcass quality. They are produced as broilers\nand sent to market for meat purposes.\nFor good production of poultry birds, good\nmanagement practices are important. These\ninclude maintenance of temperature and\nhygienic conditions in housing and poultry\nfeed, as well as prevention and control of\ndiseases and pests.\nThe \nhousing, \nnutritional \nand\nenvironmental requirements of broilers are\nsomewhat different from those of egg layers.\nQ\nQ\nReprint 2025-26"

Marine fish are caught\nusing many kinds of fishing nets from fishing\nboats. Yields are increased by locating large\nschools of fish in the open sea using satellites\nand echo-sounders.\nSome marine fish of high economic value\nare also farmed in seawater. This includes\nfinned fishes like mullets, bhetki, and pearl\nspots, shellfish such as prawns (Fig. 12.5),\nmussels and oysters as well as seaweed.\nOysters are also cultivated for the pearls\nthey make.\nMacrobrachium rosenbergii\n(fresh water)\nPeneaus monodon\n(marine)\nFig. 12.5 : Fresh water and marine prawns\nAs marine fish stocks get further depleted,\nthe demand for more fish can only be met by\nsuch culture fisheries, a practice called\nmariculture.\n12.2.3 (ii)  INLAND FISHERIES\nFresh water resources include canals, ponds,\nreservoirs and rivers. Brackish water\nresources, where seawater and fresh water\nmix together, such as estuaries and lagoons\nare also important fish reservoirs. While\ncapture fishing is also done in such inland\nwater bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish\nproduction from these resources is through\naquaculture.\nFish culture is sometimes done in\ncombination with a rice crop, so that fish are\ngrown in the water in the paddy field. More\nintensive fish farming can be done in\ncomposite fish culture systems. Both local\nand imported fish species are used in such\nsystems.\nIn such a system, a combination of five or\nsix fish species is used in a single fishpond.\nThese species are selected so that they do\nnot compete for food among them having\ndifferent types of food habits. As a result, the\nfood available in all the parts of the pond is\nused. As Catlas are surface feeders, Rohus\nfeed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals\nand Common Carps are bottom feeders, and\nGrass Carps feed on the weeds, together these\nspecies (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the\npond without competing with each other. This\nincreases the fish yield from the pond.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFig. 12.6: (a) Catla (b) Silver carp  (c) Rohu (d) Grass\nCarp (e) Mrigal (f) Common Carp\n(e)\n(f)\nOne problem with such composite fish\nculture is that many of these fish breed only\nduring monsoon. Even if fish seed is collected\nfrom the wild, it can be mixed with that of\nother species as well. So, a major problem in\nfish farming is the lack of availability of good-\nquality seed. To overcome this problem, ways\nhave now been worked out to breed these fish\nin ponds using hormonal stimulation. This\nhas ensured the supply of pure fish seed in\ndesired quantities.\nReprint 2025-26"

Since bee-keeping\nneeds low investments, farmers use it as an\nadditional income generating activity. In\naddition to honey, the beehives are a source\nof wax which is used in various medicinal\npreparations.\nThe local varieties of bees used for\ncommercial honey production are Apis cerana\nindica, commonly known as the Indian bee,\nA. dorsata, the rock bee and A. florae, the little\nbee. An Italian bee variety, A. mellifera, has\nalso been brought in to increase yield of honey.\nThis is the variety commonly used for\ncommercial honey production.\nThe Italian bees have high honey collection\ncapacity. They sting somewhat less. They stay\nin a given beehive for long periods, and breed\nvery well. For commercial honey production,\nbee farms or apiaries are established.\nThe value or quality of honey depends\nupon the pasturage, or the flowers available\nto the bees for nectar and pollen collection.\nIn addition to adequate quantity of pasturage,\nthe kind of flowers available will determine\nthe taste of the honey.\nuestions\n1.\nWhat \nare \nthe \ndesirable\ncharacters of bee varieties\nsuitable for honey production?\n2.\nWhat is pasturage and how is it\nrelated to honey production?\nQ\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 12.7: (a) Arrangement of beehive in an apiary\n(b) honey extractor\nQ\nWhat\nyou have\nlearnt\n•\nThere are several nutrients essential for crops.
